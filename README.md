👋 Hi, I’m Aidan Bell (@AidanRBell)
📕 I'm a second year student at Western University, in Honours Specialization of Computer Science, with a Minor in Game Development.
😁 My interests include Computer Science, Music, Video Games, Finance, and Streetwear.
📝 I’m currently learning general Computer Science and Software Engineering Fundamentals, and more specifically Game Developement and Artificial Inteligence.
🛠 My current project is a 2D Platforming Game on Unity. I've been developing it in my spare time starting in July 2022 from the ground up.
👥 I’m looking to collaborate on part-time jobs or internships delving into programming fundamentals, game development, software engineering, and/or artificial intelligence.
